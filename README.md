# 🚀 My Developer Portfolio 👨‍💻

Welcome to my **Developer Portfolio**! 🎉  
This is where the magic happens (well, some of it 🧙‍♂️). Right now, it’s like a work-in-progress pizza 🍕—it’s good, but it’s going to get a whole lot better with some more toppings and that perfect crust! 

## Coming Soon™ 🚧
This portfolio is like software—never fully done, always improving!  
Future updates will include:
- **⚡ More projects** (because coding is life 💻)
- **🌗 Dark/Light Mode** – because who doesn’t love a little contrast?  
- **🐛 Bug fixes** (I swear, it's a feature not a bug... sometimes 🤷‍♂️)

## Want to Follow Along?
Feel free to **star** ⭐ the repo and come back later for updates! Or just hang around and watch me try to look productive. 🙃
